## Automate when virtual machines should be turned on and off

This project contains code that will deploy resources that will help you managed virtual machines and when they should be up and running and not. 

It deploys all required resources needed and comes with two powershell-scripts you can use to managed more than one virtual machine in an easy fashion. 

For more information about the project you can visit my website where I have a post about implementing and managing this solution:
